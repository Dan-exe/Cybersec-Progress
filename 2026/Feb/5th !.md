More linux / bash fluency, some learning on metasploit and how people develop their own metasploit scripts. Setup a general plan for attacking security+ prep and whilst waiting for my linkedin learning license to materialise on the 10th, I'll just keep working on TryHackMe. This sat on the 7th I will get back into boxes when I establish a general approach for each type of target, I need to relearn netcat and establishing a reverse shell. At least this time around in trying boxes my bash fluency is elevated thru use of various bash based apps in work and uni. 

I want to probe more into sleuthing also, with methods for finding info on people or machines using readily available services online. I remember OSINT methodology in my ASD work experience and it being quite fun.

Metasploit Framework:

- automated tools such as metaploit allow for a more generic workflow approach to be taken into vulnerable environments and give a foundational start to each problem. But understanding what the tool does for you is important as to not become reliant on tools such as msf.

Also started [Network Enumeration w/ Nmap](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/19) for the time being whilst I wait for a few days, I should be able to finish it quickly. I'll also try and get this [metasploit](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/39) one done too
