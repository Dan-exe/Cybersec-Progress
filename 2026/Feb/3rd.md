Day One: Setting up Kali on a VM and getting into tryHackMe
I already have some experience with Kali and did some HackTheBox etc. in my past.
Just need to get back into it and become more fluent in vim and linux terminal.

Linux Basic Commands:

    - find -name ***   
        -name specifies file name
        -to find all files with same extension
         use *.ext
    - grep "***" filename
        -to find things in a file via ***
        -'-r' will search recursively thru every
         file in the directory and all subdirectories

    Operators:
    - '&' allows you to run commands in the background of
     your terminal
    - '&&' allows you to combine multiple commands together
    - '>' redirect so send output to some specified file
    - '>>' does the same as '>' but appends rather than 
      overwrites
