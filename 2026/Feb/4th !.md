today I was approved for a linkedin learning license from Wisetech so I'll utilise that whilst its active and I want to finish a few courses or at least steal the content if I cant get through them before it becomes inactive in march. I will be aiming to get my CompTia Security + cert within 6ish months as a baseline for some resume buffering. I worked on a few TryHackMe short courses as well whilst waiting for a full repo build... still in the beginning stages so everything is more of a refresher, using nmap, pinging a system etc... Though I realise now that it would be helpful for me to note down a general procedure for how to start my approach to each box since I usually always start floundering and thinking wow I rlly just done know where to start. Definitely need to solidify my network understanding for web based pen testing and sleuthing as it's a weakness of mine.

Some more generic commands in bash which i forgot about: 
- touch ~ create empty file
- nano ~ simple bash text editor 
- vim ~ preferred text editor to nano to write scripts
- chmod ~ change permission requirements on file
	- u - user 
	- +x executable for everyone
	- eg. chmod u+x filename.sh
